# song poll

Spotify's release radar does not update often enough for me, nor does it contain enough songs. 

**song poll** is a program that will query the Spotify API for each artist specified, check if any of them have released any new tracks since the last check time, then add these tracks to a playlist.

This is primarily a personal project that will be updated with features I want.
